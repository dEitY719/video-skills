"""Hermes Agent registration for the `video` skills plugin.

Registers the hf-motion skill with Hermes' native skill loader so
`skill_view("video:<name>")` can load it on demand.

This plugin injects no session bootstrap context. The skill is explicitly
invoked - you reach for it when you want a motion graphic rendered from a
recipe - and every run writes a project directory and spends minutes of
render time, so a bootstrap preamble nudging the model toward it would be
wrong.
